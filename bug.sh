# The bug is related to how it handles files and directories.

  # Simulate some processing, this is where it might fail if file is a directory
  # It only prints the file name, but in a real application, this could be a command that only accepts files as input.
  #  Example: some_command "$file"
  # In this example the problem is implicit, as the failure will depend on some_command's behaviour
  # if "$file" is a directory.
  # A more explicit error would occur if you were to try and open the file for reading
  # using a command that doesn't gracefully handle directories
